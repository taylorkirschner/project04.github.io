# Project 4
Project contains two files, index.html & _config.yml.

index.html --> main coding script. Contains all relevant code that makes up my webpage, including the MQTT protocol.

_config.yml --> a theme that I choose on GitHub pages set up. Seems to work on certain browsers and not on others.

For my MQTT broker, I used MQTTX, using the following settings:
Name: test
Client ID: tklab
Host: ws://broker.emqx.io
Port: 8083
Path: /mqtt
